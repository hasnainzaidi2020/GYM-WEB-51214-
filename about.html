                    A gym - physical exercises and activities performed inside, often using equipment, especially when done as a subject at school. Gymnasium is a large room with equipment for exercising the body and increasing strength or a club where you can go to exercise and keep fit.
                    <br>
                    A gym is a gymnasium, also known as health club and fitness centre. Gymnasiums have moved away just being a location for gymnastics. Where they had gymnastics apparatus such as bar bells, parallel bars, jumping boards and running path etc.
                    If you are looking to join a gymnastics club, please see gymnastics.
                    A health club, fitness centre is now commonly referred to as a gym.
                    Choosing the right gym for you
Most gyms have a wide range of ages and levels of fitness. Don’t buy into the preconception that it will be full of supreme athletes!
<br>
<h3>Coast</h3>
 Before joining any gym, it is highly recommended that you shop around and go on a visit before joining up. You should check joining options, no joining fee, pay-as-go, free trail periods, no joining fee, First  month free, corporation discounts and off peak discounts. Avoid long term agreements which can tie you into an agreement for anything between 1-3 years!

If you are looking for a specialised class – men only, woman only or seniors etc check the gym offers this. Gyms that do offer these tend to also have specialised programs for the target market. Aquasize classes for seniors by way of an example.

During your tour you should ask about any special offers?

How many members do they currently have? (As overcrowding can result in you waiting for equipment)

What are the busy times?  Try to avoid peak times as again you may have to wait for equipment.

Also check equipment, Facilities and staff.
<br>
<h3>Induction day</h3>
It is important to arrange an induction day prior to you starting to use the gym. This is for your own safety, as misuse of equipment may not just leave you feeling embarrassed but could result in injury. Every gym will offer an induction day.

Induction days vary from gym to gym, but should ideally include an initial 1-2-1 health and fitness consultation. Your instructor should familiarise you with all gym equipment. Some provide initial exercise programs and regular follow up consultations and reviews.

It is important to choose a gym that facilitates for your needs, make sure the gym provides a clean, safe and friendly environment that you can fit into.
